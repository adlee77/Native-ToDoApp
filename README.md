# To-Do App

## Simple To-Do App Created on React Native
This is my first React Native App. I created this to practice getting used to the components used in React Native versus React JS. It uses map and filter functions to create and remove tasks.

Users can type in a task, click on the task to complete it (task will be greyed out), and click remove to remove the task from the list.
